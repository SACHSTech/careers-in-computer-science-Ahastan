# Systems Eningeer (IT)
## __The Basics__
### _What is a Systems Engineer?_
---
System engineering is defined as the integration of multiple disciplines to sanction the use of engineering systems using principles, concepts and theories from scientific, technological and management methods. 

In essence, system engineers are responsible for designing, developing, and initiating an interdisciplinary approach of multiple engineering systems. They work to gain perspective of all aspects of a system in order to solve problems. These “systems” may include products, people, services, information, natural elements or processes. One must know how to troubleshoot and communicate with all associations in order for the proper implementation and use of such a system.

### _Responsibilities of a Systems Engineer:_
---
1. Designing and implementing systems & tools
2. Troubleshooting issues
3. Automating tasks in manufacturing environments
4. Installing hardware and software
5. Undergoing system upgrades
6. Ensuring backup & recovery
7. Server capacity planning and monitoring
8. Conducting version management
9. Overseeing the development of system security standards
10. Assessing resources to meet the organizational needs

### _Required Educaiton:_
---
Although exentsive, there are quite a large variety of pathways one may take to become a systems engineer such as a:

1. Bachelor's Degree

   There are many bachelors degree one can undergo in order to become a system engineer, all relating to a multitude of fields within computer science. 
   
   Some specific coursework includes: physics, calculus, project management, statistics and computer systems programming.

2. Master's Degree
   
   Often times, pursuing a master’s degree allows for a specification of a specific industry, allowing for a plethora of job opportunities once entrusted into the industry. 
   
   Pursuing a Masters allows one to gain further experience in their industry of choice, allowing them to hit the ground running when they start their new job as a systems engineer

3. Certification
   
   Apart from pursuing the traditional route of a bachelors/masters degree, one may also choose to earn certifications to demonstrate their preparedness to various employers
   
   Some certifications include:
      * Microsoft Certified Systems Engineer (MCSE)
      * Certified Systems Engineering Professional (CSEP)
      * Master Certified Electronics Technician (CETma)
      * Cisco Certified Network Associate (CCNA)
      * Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP)
      * CompTIA Network+

### _Technical Skills:_
---

Technical skills are required in any job, and are the skills associated with the specialized knowledge to perform specific tasks that are unique to the job. However, in terms of a systems engineer, this varies quite drastically due to the industry that one is in. Thus, in general, it is important to have sufficient knowledge all fields regarding:
* Computer engineering
* Software development
* Project management
* Networking
* Cloud computing
* Data architecture and programming
* Risk management

### _Non-Technical Skills:_
---

Non-technical skills are the skills that are required of a profession that are not specifically attributed to the job in order to complete tasks of that job. For a systems engineer, this includes critical thinking, analytical skills (analyzing problems), troubleshooting, and implementation of key solutions. Communication skills are also quite significant such as collaboration (working with others) and customer service skills. Finally, time management is a significant skill essential for systems engineers as they often have many responsibilities to undertake.

### _Salary Range:_
---
The average base salary for a systems engineer in Canada is approximately $85, 236/year. The most experienced workers may earn up to an average of $122, 671/year.

## __Standard Education__
### _Post-Secondary Programs:_
---
The two Post-Secondary programs in relation to a system engineer are:

1. Systems Design Engineering
2. Management Engineering

### _University Insitution:_
---
Both programs are found at the University of Waterloo in Waterloo, Ontario.

## __Experiential Learning__

Although it is widely believed that in order to work in any tech-related field, many years of education is required, it can also be done by other means.
   
In order to be a systems engineer, the two skills required revolve around the technical and non-technical aspects.

One significant experiential learning pathway towards becoming a systems engineer is through partaking in co-op and internship programs offered through school.
   
* Through co-op, students learn essential workplace skills that allow them to mold quickly in their new work environments.
* They learn to transfer their knowledge in the classroom to the outside world, and learn to appreciate the fruits of their education.
* As such, the skills they learn can be applied to who they are as a whole, allowing them to expand their proficiency in their field.
* They may also be able to work at their co-op placement after graduation, allowing for them to continue their work.

One important skill for system engineers is project management skills. This skills are important, as one must learn to know how to work in group environments, troubleshoot, and set clear goals

* One way to learn project managing skills is through launching/joining a start-up company. Launching such allows one to go through many hurdles, but regardless learn a lot in the end. Learning to set goals, plan accordingly, prioritize, troubleshoot, collaborating and communicating are essential non-technical skills that a systems engineer should have.
* Another way to learn project managing skills is by having a side-hustle. This could be anything, ranging from freelance tutoring to having a gig. It allows one to do the same: learn by going through obstacles in a small-scale setting.
   
Finally, an important technical skill to learn when it comes to systems engineering is having a strong background in computer science.

* There are many ways to expand a background in such field, some being earning certifications, taking courses from an educational institution, learning on YouTube, or even starting to work in a basic IT setting.
* The prolonged experience gained from such backgrounds will allow one to continuously excel in the field, developing a stable background in computer science.

Nevertheless, the term “engineer” is typically only earned through formal education (diploma/degree/certificate). Despite such experiential learning opportunities, to be considered in the position of an engineer means that one must be registered through Professional Engineers Ontario, requiring one to earn a bachelor’s degree in an accredited engineering program.
